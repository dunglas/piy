sfAnotherReCaptchaPlugin
========================

sfAnotherReCaptchaPlugin is a Symfony plugin allowing you to uses the reCAPTCHA
system in your forms.

[reCAPTCHA](http://recaptcha.net) is a free CAPTCHA service that helps to digitize books, newspapers
and old time radio shows.
A CAPTCHA is a program that can tell whether its user is a human or a computer.
CAPTCHAs are used by many websites to prevent abuse from "bots," or automated
programs usually written to generate spam. No computer program can read
distorted text as well as humans can, so bots cannot navigate sites protected by
CAPTCHAs.

This plugin is based on
[sfReCaptchaPlugin](http://www.symfony-project.org/plugins/sfReCaptchaPlugin).
Unlike sfReCaptchaPlugin, sfAnotherReCaptchaPlugin provides you a "new form"
reCAPTCHA widget.

It also provides a "mailhide" helper.

Installation
------------

Put this directory under the `plugins` directory of your Symfony installation.
Edit your `app.yml` config file and add:

    recaptcha:
      public_key:      <your public reCAPTCHA key>
      private_key:     <your private reCAPTCHA key>

Usage
-----

Create a reCAPTCHA widget with `new sfWidgetFormReCaptcha()`.

For example, in a Propel form you can use the following code to add a CAPTCHA
at the end of the generated form.

    $this->widgetSchema['captcha'] = new sfAnotherWidgetFormReCaptcha();

The validator is called `sfAnotherValidatorSchemaReCaptcha`. You can use it as Post
validator like that:

    $this->validatorSchema->setPostValidator(
      new sfAnotherValidatorSchemaReCaptcha($this, 'captcha')
    );

For a real life example see the SelfPublish register form code.

Mailhide installation
---------------------

Edit your `app.yml` config file and add:

    mailhide:
      public_key:      <your public reCAPTCHA key>
      private_key:     <your private reCAPTCHA key>

Mailhide usage
--------------

In a template:

    <?php use_helper('recaptcha'); ?>

    <?php echo recaptcha_mailhide_html(sfConfig::get('app_mailhide_public_key'), 
      sfConfig::get('app_mailhide_private_key'), 'foo@bar.com'); ?>
